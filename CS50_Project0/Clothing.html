              <h3>Jersey</h3>
              <p>Most MTB jerseys will have a loose cut and will come in T-shirt, ¾ length sleeve or long-sleeved options. Prices are generally lower than road cycling jerseys, and there’s a huge range of colours and designs out there.

                Cross-country mountain bikers tend to wear a Lycra jersey, along the lines of a road cycling jersey, with rear pockets which are ideal for stowing spare tubes, tools and snacks.</p>
              <h3>Shorts, liner shorts and baggy shorts</h3>
              <p>Padded shorts are a good idea because mountain biking by its very nature takes place on rough terrain, and riders spend time repeatedly getting in and out of the saddle.

                Road-cycling-style Lycra shorts or bib shorts with a chamois pad are ideal either on their own or as a baselayer with a pair of baggy MTB shorts over the top. You can also find padded shorts made of lightweight material or mesh which are designed to be used just as liners under baggy shorts.
                
                The baggy shorts will usually be knee-length and constructed from either a stretchy material or a robust, tear-resistant fabric with stretch panels around the back to allow the shorts to move with the rider. They should also have room for kneepads to fit underneath.</p>
              <h3>Socks</h3>
              <p>As well as being a way of expressing your style, long socks can help protect the shins and calves from scratches and cuts from undergrowth or from the pedals themselves.

                Waterproof socks are very popular with mountain bikers who ride in wet conditions because they help keep feet warm and relatively dry when shoes get wet.
                
                There’s also the option of putting waterproof shoe covers over the top of riding shoes, which adds even more wet weather protection.</p>
              <h3>Shoes</h3>
              <p>When it comes to contact points — where the rider makes contact with the bike — the shoe/pedal point is one of the most important. Riders need to feel secure when riding over rough ground that their feet won’t come away from the pedal, and also feel like they can pedal efficiently up tough, technical climbs.

                There are two choices on offer. Lots of trail and cross-country riders will choose to ride clipped in, like road cyclists, with a mechanism that connects a cleat on the sole of the shoe to the pedal. Other riders opt to ride with ‘flat’ shoes and pedals, where the pedals have a rough textured surface and ‘pins’ that project outward to grip the shoes.
                
                Clipless shoes look like road cycling shoes but will have a recessed cleat and a chunky tread to allow the rider to walk a little more normally.
                
                Flat pedal shoes tend to look more like skate shoes or trainers, and will usually have a lace-up fastening. They also have a sole that combines a tread pattern that works with the pedal pins and is made from extra-grippy rubber for the same reason.</p>
              <h3>Waterproof jacket</h3>
              <p>s with every other type of cycling, mountain biking can be a year-round activity if you have the right kit (and if the ground isn’t completely covered with snow).

                A good waterproof jacket is part of this and a waterproof jacket designed for mountain biking will tend to have a looser fit to accommodate layers and body armour underneath, and to allow greater freedom of movement.
                
                There will usually be a couple of pockets too for stowing essentials and snacks, as well as vents for keeping the internal temperature down when exerting hard efforts, such as on climbs.</p>
